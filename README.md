Note: 
**Why do we require branch model?**

		 

> Lets assume you are writing a code, for a feature called mobile login, initially the requirement would be for mobile login for all the country. you wrote code by considering all the country code, you may have finished 80% of work, later client says we are  just releasing this phase in India so lets finish it fast only do it for India. So you have to remove 40% code and make changes, tomorrow the client says they decided to release in all the country so they require the feature, so you would have to rework and build it.

> Instead of doing this if you create a new branch(feature/merchant-v1.0) from the feature/merchant, then tomorrow you can pull from the existing and continue the work.
